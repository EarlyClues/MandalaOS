29 April 2011 â€“ Santorini, Greece

The other night up in Ardaktos, after finding dittany at Costas' house, I dreamt that a man and woman appeared in the warehouse where I'd been living in Baltimore.  They broke down the flimsily-constructed walls of my small room, and the debris of my life was laid bare. I grabbed a wrench and carefully completed the disassembly of the broken-down walls, and assisted them in building something like a sweat lodge. Myself and my mysterious dream woman were, I guess, to be initiated in this lodge. Before entering, the older woman warned me - with a sternness bordering on anger - not to enter unless I was serious, for people have died in this place. I bowed my head and entered with due humility. Inside, it was explained that the smoke which rises from churches carrying prayers to heaven collects in this lodge. 

Immediately after, I dreamt that from painless wounds in my body red crystal jewels issued forth - that my body 'wept' them out - and that with them, I could perform feats of magic.
